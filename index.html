                Web development is easy if someone stays focused and gets proper guidance. This is my first webpage! and
                I am
                struggling a lot. But I am hopeful because I know I would not master without struggling.

            <p>A personal mission statement defines who you are as a person and
                identifies your purpose, whether that's in the office or simply in life. It explains how you aim to
                pursue that purpose, and why it matters so much to you.</p>

                HeroicProgramming, usually a pejorative term, is used to describe the expenditure of huge amounts of
                (coding) effort by talented people to overcome shortcomings in process, project management, scheduling,
                architecture or any other shortfalls in the execution of a software development project in order to
                complete it.

                GoCorona (GC) is a digital contact tracing app for COVID-19. It uses Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to
                advertise and collect a random device ID of other nearby GCG users. These anonymized "contact" IDs are
                sent to a backend server and stitched to form a temporal contact network. Analytics over this network
                helps evaluate various risk scores for a user. It also helps quickly identify primary, secondary and
                tertiary contacts with users who are later diagnosed as COVID positive.
